Request Forms and Files

You can define files and form fields at the same time using 
`File` and `Form`.

---

Info 

To receive uploaded files and/or form data, first install 
`python-multipart`.

E.g., `pip install python-multipart`.

-----

Import `File` and `Form`
"""

from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, Form, UploadFile

"""
Define `File` and `Form` parameters

Create file and form parameters the same way you would for `Body` or `Query`:
"""

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/files/")
async def create_file(
    file: Annotated[bytes, File()],
    fileb: Annotated[UploadFile, File()],
    token: Annotated[str, Form()],
):
    return {
        "file_size": len(file),
        "token": token,
        "fileb_content_type": fileb.content_type,
    }

"""
The files and form fields will be uploaded as form data and you will receive 
the files and form fields.

And you can declare some of the files as `bytes` and some as `UploadFile`.

---

Warning

You can declare multiple `File` and `Form` parameters in a 
Path Operation, but you can't also declare `Body` fields that 
you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body 
encoded using `multipart/form-data` instead of `application/json`.

This is not a limitation of FastAPI, it's part of the HTTP 
protocol.

-----

Recap 

Use `File` and `Form` together when you need to receive 
data and files in the same request.
